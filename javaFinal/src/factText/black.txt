you dislike cats
you have a bright future
you are fearful of goats
you secretly want to become a cowboy
you find joy in spiders
you are skilled in archery
you own a pet turkey named alberta
when you grow up you want to be laura bush
you have a fondness for gas station burritos
you believe in conspiracy theories 
you have a courageous heart
