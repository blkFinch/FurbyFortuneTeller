feel hopeful--it's not all horrible
you will be terrible at curling
a root vegetable will arrive
try hiking with llamas
beware comfortable clothes taking on leadership roles
practice mindfulness
invent new methods
aspire to raise prize-winning goldfish for a living
you are highly imaginative 
the occasional beekeeper will arrive
avoid candy
carry a good luck charm
your next experience will be meaningful
you might manage a wagon train one day 
beware an objective potato
in case of danger, seek the safety crystal
you are an independent humanitarian
answers will arrive with the next house-plant 
sell a belonging only for the right sum
be cautious when planning your next shower 
yours is a tale of glory
try ironing perler beads in your spare time   
the next penny you find will become important
trust the next dog you see
there are important shapes to be found here
