the night orchid will guide you
beware any dogs ominous in appearance
this may be important later
pay attention to unusual patterns
seek the dark crystal for answers
you must free the small owl
the message is a trap
you may trade for an important object soon
the door must be unlocked to proceed
your tale is one of magnificence
there will be a confession 
try skateboarding someday
your journey may be upended soon
for protection, craft a moon sheild
the universe will soon be unveiled
look in the weaving for answers
your former self will assist you
follow your heart to the end
sometimes sad happens
it's all happening inside your head
avoid orange juice for a short time
there are good things ahead
your existence will be confirmed
be careful
you will soon discover spacetime
