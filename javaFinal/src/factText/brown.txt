watch for the next singal 
beware ravens of a mysterious appearence
you have a courageous heart
seek a pink crystal
aspire to become a protector of baby elephants 
scared librarians are not well-organized
freedom is the greatest treasure  
lobsters will foresee the demise of mankind
the rules of the universe will be discovered 
your instructions will arrive promptly
for protection, create many fake names 
the truth will be revealed
look for the traveler
don't worry, the managers are expecting the worst
the alter-ego is a resourceful cowboy
there is an imposter here
pay attention to important shapes
someone thinks of you often
haikus will present themselves
the plan involves many people
quality craftmanship will be everything
beware the petty thief
prepare to battle 
when confronted with an unforeseen problem, you may panic
itâ€™s likely you were born once
